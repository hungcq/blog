Today is the last day of the year, an important day for Vietnamese and other Chinese-influenced culture.
I and my girlfriend just came back from a trip to Phuket.
Back to our apartment in Saigon, all shops/markets had already been closed,
we ended up having nothing to prepare for the last moment of the year.
We ate out in an Indian restaurant instead, which didn't close during Tet. But we were happy.
