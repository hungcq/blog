## "The" question and "the" comment

"Why are you so thin?" is the question.

"You are too thin" is the comment.

I receive that question and comment too often to the point I get bored.
It usually happens in a casual conversation, in which I don't have enough time to give a proper reply or explanation.
So I think it is better to write it down and save some energy by not repeating it too many times.

## Why are you so impolite and stupid?

Sorry, what I mean is that you are probably not too polite and knowledgeable.

Here is what you don't know about me and my health. I'm fit for pretty much any physical and mental activity.
I can run half-marathons, go trekking, do bouldering, lift heavy objects, have good sex, work long hours,
learn a wide range of subjects. I haven't been sick or taken any medicine in 3 years (and only once in 6 years).
That's why I'm very confident and comfortable with my health, given the time and resources I invest in maintaining it.
And increasing my weight is not my priority now, since it doesn't serve any purpose while costing a lot of time.
Also, I'm pretty sure I have more knowledge about biology and health than you do, since you asked such stupid questions.

Of you being impolite, what would you feel when I ask questions like "Why are you so fat/unfit/weak"?
Of course such questions cross my mind very often, since I am very health conscious,
but I don't ask because I know either you know but are comfortable with your current level of health,
or you don't know enough to do anything about it. Either way, I don't want to annoy you or be impolite.

## "But my intention is good"

Yeah, I know right. But it doesn't matter to me whether you have good intentions or not.
The thing that matters is that hearing such questions and such comments annoys me.
It also costs me mental energy to curb my annoyance and to forgive you for not knowing more.

Please try to think a bit before opening your mouth. You will not only appear more decent to other people,
but will also be on your way towards being a more thinking, cultured human being.
